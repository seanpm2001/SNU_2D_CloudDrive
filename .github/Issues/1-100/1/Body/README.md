### Can't upload WAV Pcloud audio sample

I can't upload the pCloud audio sample that is in WAV format, as it exceeds the GitHub 25 megabyte file limit. I have tried multiple methods of compression, but I have been unable to get it below 26.1 megabytes, which is still over 1.1 megabytes over the limit.

If anyone knows how to compress it without losing its original data, feel free to upload a copy.
