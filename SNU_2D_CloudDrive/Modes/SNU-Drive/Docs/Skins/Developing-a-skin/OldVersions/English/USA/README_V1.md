## Skin development

### Developing a skin

SNU CloudDrive skins offer a personalized experience for making your drive look completely different through the use of SVG skins.

#### Developing a basic skin

Basic skins take the least time to develop. They just require graphic design for the essential icons. This must be done in SVG format. These skins are estimated to take between 5-800 minutes to make (depending on the quality level)

#### Developing a supplemental skin

Supplemental skins contain a much larger scope of icons to work with. They are called supplemental skins, as the level of design of a skin is put into 2 categories: mandatory (a basic skin) and supplemental (a full skin) If you choose to design one, the steps are identical to a basic skin, with the additional steps of designing more icons. Developing a supplemental skin (as of DriveSkn V3) can take between 12 hours, and 33 days.

There are over 400 icons to design (as of DriveSkn V3)
